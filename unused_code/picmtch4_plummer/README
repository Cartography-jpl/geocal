We had a summer student Bryan Plummer here the summer of 2012. He worked with
refactoring pictmtch4 as part of the work he did with the MSPI project. His code
is in the MISR repository at http://ulfrun/svn/MSPI-Ground. This is a copy
of that code, which we will integrate into GeoCal. We keep the original code 
here for reference.
