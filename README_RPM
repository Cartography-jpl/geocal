To make a RPM for installing as a redhat package, we can do the following:

1. Do a configure using the configure found in this file.
2. make distcheck. 
3. cp afids-python-r1268.0.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
4. rpmbuild -ba <srcdir>/afids-python.spec

We then have the RPMs ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/afids-python-r1268-1.x86_64.rpm and
~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/afids-python-r1268-1.src.rpm which can be copied to a repository.
