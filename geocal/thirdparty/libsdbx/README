SDBX
Copyright (C) 2008 Dustin Spicuzza <dustin@virtualroadside.com>

SDBX is a generic high-performance set of tree containers for C++ that can
be either stored directly in memory or in files, with adjustable caching 
and node size parameters. Currently it includes modified B/B+ tree and an 
R* Tree implementation. Additionally, SDBX contains a number of storage 
and serialization items that are used to accomplish these goals.

1. BUILD/INSTALLATION

You don't. Its entirely template-based. Just include the files. If you want
to install it, then I suppose you could copy the files somewhere.

Parts of SDBX depend on wxWidgets -- it should only be the parts that deal
with writing to file, however. The rest of SDBX does not have dependencies 
other than a modern C++ compiler that has good template support, and the STL.

3. RATIONALE

As I was working on improvements for LibRoadnav's map data storage, I was
focused on making a set of generic containers that could do what I
needed it to do. However, along the way the containers worked out so well
that I think it deserved to be in its own library, and thus SDBX was born.

I'm not quite sure what SDBX stands for yet, its probably something along the
lines of 'Simple DataBase X..something'. Xtreme? Who knows. 

This library is required to build or use LibRoadnav, thus why it is included
with it directly.

At the moment, I'm not 100% sure what the future direction of this library is,
though it certainly will be developed according to the needs of LibRoadnav. 
In fact, it may never get distributed seperately from libroadnav. However, 
it makes sense to keep it somewhat independent.. I think. We'll see.

Please report any Roadnav-related bugs to the appropriate roadnav resources,
and any non-Roadnav SDBX bugs (though its hard to see how that could happen)
directly to dustin@virtualroadside.com. Thanks!
