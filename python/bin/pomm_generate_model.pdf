Pomm_Generate_Model
.HELP
pomm_generate_model takes an unprojected PDS or ISIS image, imports it to
VICAR, and adds a RSM or GLAS/GFM.

A PDS image can be passed to the program, or an already process ISIS image.
The ISIS cube image can be useful if you want more control on how the data
is processed (e.g., using various options in ISIS). If you pass an ISIS
cube, the kernels should already be listed in the file (e.g., spiceinit
should be run on it). For PDS images, we just to a direct import to ISIS
followed by running spiceinit with the --web option but otherwise using
the spiceinit defaults.

The HiRISE instrument has 14 different CCDs, and each comes as 2 "channels"
which is the left and right portion of the CCD image. You should supply
both channels for a CCD image.

Some datasets have multiple bands (e.g., LRO WAC color images). You can
specify the band to use.

We do not do any radiance correction (e.g., dark current subtraction),
we just pass through the DNs unchanged. However, for CTX camera the
data is at level 0 is normally SQRT encoded. We do expand that out to 
unencoded data.

Currently the specific forms of the RSM are hard coded based on the 
instrument type.

Example:
    pomm_generate_model /raid26/tllogan/mars/mawrth_vallis/source/unmapped/P16_007388_2049_XI_24N020W.IMG ctx1
    rsm_project --grid-spacing=10 --map-info=ctx1_ref_img.xml --number-process=20 --verbose --process-number-line=1000 --process-number-sample=1000 ctx1.img ctx1_proj.img

.LEVEL1
.variable pdsimg
The PDS image we are importing
and adding a RSM to.
.variable pdsimg2
For HiRISE, the second channel of the PDS image
we are importing and adding a RSM to.
.variable outbase
Name to use when forming the
first part of the output file
names.
.variable fulligc

For diagnostic purposes, it
can be useful to have the full
IGC (i.e., the one with the
camera model, spice kernel,
etc.). This is what we
are approximating with the
RSM.
.variable band
Some datasets have multiple
bands (e.g., LRO WAC color 
images). You can specify the
band to use.
.variable rsm
If set to "y" use a RSM
model rather than a GLAS/GFM.
Default is "n"
.variable minh
Minimum DEM height we create
RSM for. Note this doesn't
need to be super accurate,
just a reasonable value that
is lower than any height we
will encounter over the area.
.variable .maxh
Maximum DEM height we create
RSM for. Note this doesn't
need to be super accurate,
just a reasonable value that
is lower than any height we
will encounter over the area.
.variable plot 
To evaluate the quality of the
generated RSM, this takes a
cross section for all lines,
and 5 equally spaced samples
and plots the difference
between the calculated line
and sample vs. what the full
ImageGroundConnection
calculation creates. Output
is a PDF file.
.variable rscale
Scale to apply to raw data
when importing it.
