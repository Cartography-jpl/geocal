This directory contains the input files used by the python Sphinx documentation
tool (see http://sphinx.pocoo.org).

This directory does not contain the actual documentation, but rather contains
the input files used to generate that documentation. The documentation can be 
found in the install directory at share/doc/afids/python/index.html.

This is installed as part of the normal "make install" process.
