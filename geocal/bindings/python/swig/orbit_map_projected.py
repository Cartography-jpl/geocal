    Note that this class is deprecated, it is redundant with
    IgcMapProjected just passing in a OrbitDataGroundConnection.

    But leave this is place now until we are ready to remove this.

    This is a RasterImage that has been map projected using OrbitData and
    a Camera.

    To do this we do two steps:

    We calculate roughly what the difference in resolution is between the
    original data and final MapInfo. We do this by looking at the center
    pixel of the original data and the pixel +1 in line and sample. We
    then use RasterAveraged to average the original data to roughly the
    resolution of the final MapInfo. If the final MapInfo is near the same
    resolution as the original, or if it has a higher resolution, then we
    don't do any averaging. Alternatively, you can pass in the averaging
    factor.

    We then interpolate the possibly averaged data to the final
    projection.

    It is ok if the final MapInfo contains areas outside of the original
    data. For any pixel outside of the original data, we just return a
    value of 0.

    This class calculates the data on the fly. Sometimes this is what you
    want, but if you are going to be using the resulting data a few times,
    you may want to use a MemoryRasterImage to generate a copy once and
    keep it in memory.
