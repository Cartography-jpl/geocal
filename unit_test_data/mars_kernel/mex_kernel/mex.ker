This is the set of kernels we always include for HRSC. In addition, you should
load the ck and spk kernel for the time period you are working with.

Right now only have ctx stuff, we may extend this in the future.

Assume we already have the geocal.ker, so we only have the additional
kernels needed.

\begindata
KERNELS_TO_LOAD = (
  'ik/MEX_HRSC_V05.TI'
)
