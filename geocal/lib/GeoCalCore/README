This contains the core of the GeoCal library. This is intended to be classes
that are either fundamental (e.g., Camera) or generally useful to many
projects (e.g., GDAL access routines).

If you are creating a new class, don't get too hung up on exactly where it
should go. All of the code gets put into one library, the division between
"Core" and "Project" is really just to organize the source code files and 
give you some hint as to where to look for a particular routine.

We divide the code into "Support", "Interface" and "Implementation". The 
idea is the "Support" is the lowest level (e.g., the GeoCal::Time class),
"Interface" is mostly abstract classes and functions that work with
the abstract classes (e.g., Camera), and "Implementation" is specific
implementations of the abstract classes (e.g., GdalRasterImage).

Again, don't get too hung up on the division. It is really just so we don't
have one directory with a hundred files in it, the division between "Support",
"Interface" and "Implemenation" is pretty loose and in many cases somewhat
arbitrary.
