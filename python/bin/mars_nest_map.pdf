.HELP
This takes an unprojected PDS image, imports it to VICAR, and adds
a RPC.

*** Note *** The RPC generated has fairly large errors vs. the rigorous
model, on the order of 3 pixels for CTX data. This is because an RPC just
doesn't capture a push broom camera super well. We will need to implement a
more generate RSM instead. Also, we are not currently correcting the RPC at
all, this is based entirely on the ephemeris/attitude knowldege.

Also not clear what to do with masked pixels. Right now, we are just passing
this on.

We are also not currently including camera nonlinearities, this is just
something we will add in a bit.

Example:
   ./mars_nest_map --mapped-image=/data/smyth/MarsTest/MawrthVallis/ctx1_full_6m.img /raid26/tllogan/mars/mawrth_vallis/source/unmapped/P16_007388_2049_XI_24N020W.IMG ctx1
    write_image --number-process=20 --verbose --process-number-line=1000 --process-number-sample=1000 ctx1_igc_proj.xml ctx1_proj.img

.LEVEL1
.variable pdsimg
PDS Image
.variable outbase
Name to use when forming the
first part of the output
.variable mapimg
Supply a mapped image we would like to compare against. We create
a base_name_igc_projected.xml file that can then be translated to
an image using write_image program.
