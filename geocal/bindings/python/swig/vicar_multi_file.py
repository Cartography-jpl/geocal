    This gives read access to some of the larger AFIDS datasets, such as
    CIB and SRTM.

    These larger datasets split into a number of VICAR files. Each one of
    these is a some extent in latitude/longitude, for example 1 x 1 degree
    tiles for the SRTM. There is an index IBIS file that gives a listing
    of all the input datasets and where they are located.

    This class gives an interface to this set of VICAR files that looks
    like one really big RasterImage.

    Note that the files might not cover the full extent of area, for
    example one of the 1x1 degree SRTM tiles might be missing. If we
    attempt to access the area covered by a missing file then an error is
    thrown. We may want to come up with a more robust interface, but for
    now this interface seems to be sufficient.

        This takes the database file (an IBIS file) and the directory that the
        files pointed to by the database file are located. The directory is
        needed because although the files are often in the same directory as
        the database file they aren't always. The database file doesn't
        contain directory information, just the file name, so we need to pass
        the directory in.

        For some odd reason, the file names also don't always have the
        extension on them. For some databases, you need to add something like
        ".img" to get the actual file name. You can pass any extension that
        is needed.

        There are two kinds of tiling going on. At the top level, we have a
        number of files open at one time, given by Number_file. For each file,
        we read that it tiles with the given Number_line_per_tile and
        Number_tile_each_file tiles.

        There are two strategies that can be used to reading a Vicar file. One
        reads a tile of a given number of lines and store it in memory. The
        other uses memory mapped file io to read data on demand. Often but not
        always the memory mapped file is faster, particularly for small files
        or for files with a large number of samples where only a portion is
        used. You can control which is used by setting Favor_memory_mapped. If
        the underlying data uses VICAR compression, then we always use the
        VICAR IO routines since memory mapping won't work. This class handles
        this case - it checks if the file is compressed before trying to do
        memory mapping.

        The Force_area_pixel forces the file to be treated as "pixel as
        area" rather than "pixel as point". This is really just meant as a
        work around for the SRTM data, which incorrectly labels the data as
        "point" rather than "area". Since this is a 15 meter difference,
        it matters for may applications. Most users should just ignore this
        value.
