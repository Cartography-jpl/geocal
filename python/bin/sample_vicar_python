# Much of the time, you can just treat python scripts as any other unix
# command. This can be called from vicar using "ush", and the python script
# doesn't need to do anything special.
#
# In cases where you need tighter integration (in particular because you are
# trying to pass back a variable to TCL), you can use the class VicarArgument.
#
# This provides a map like interface to the command arguments, so see
# the example below. 
#
# You can test this using call_sample_vicar_python.pdf
#  
#   vicarb "sample_vicar_python inp=('val1','val2') out='outname'"

from geocal import *
import sys
t = VicarArgument(sys.argv)
# Returns an array
print t["inp"]
# Return a single value
print t["out"]
# Set a output value
t["ret"] = 101
