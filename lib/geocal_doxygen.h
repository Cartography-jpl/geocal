This code is used for geometric calibration and related tasks.

\section using Using the Software

The library is written in C++. It can be used as a C++ library,
documented here. The library can also be used by higher level
languages. There are bindings to call the library from Python. 
Documentation for these are found in the normal locations for
Python documentation.

\section installation Installation and Development

The installation of this file is described in the <A HREF="./INSTALL">

\section documentation Documentation

The MISR specific geometric calibration software is described in the
<A HREF="http://www-misr.jpl.nasa.gov/project/docs/atb/atb04.pdf">
Level 1 In-Flight Geometric Calibration Algorithm Theoretical Basis
</A>

Much of the low level details of GeoCal is described in 
<A HREF="http://www-misr.jpl.nasa.gov/JPL/dfm/dfm.html">
MISR design file memos </A>

In addition to a number of standard libraries discussed in the 
<A HREF="./README.developer">
README.developer</A> file we make use of the less commonly available
libsdbx library. This supplies a R*-Tree implementation. It is
documented <A HREF="../../libsdbx/html/index.html">here</A>.
