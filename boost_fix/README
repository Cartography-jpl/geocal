Boost unfortunately had a rather serious bug in the boost serialization
introduced in boost version 1.56-1.58. The bug is described in the 
ticket #10727 found at https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10727.

This was fixed as https://github.com/boostorg/serialization/commit/a32549c25fa983fea2b5dfeaf97fbb465eb2bea0, and I believe this will be in 1.59.

Note that this fix is to the header files only, but unfortunately there is
no easy external fix. Since we don't want the users to have to patch their
system headers, I've checked out each of the include/boost/archive for 
each of the version 1.56, 1.57 and 1.58. The configuration has been set
up to shuffle the include line to pick up this patched copy of the header
files.
