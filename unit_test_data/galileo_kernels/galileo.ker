List of kernels we need for working with galileo data. This came from
the spice toolkit area, they have a section for galileo data.

As a convention, we always change to the directory this file is located
in before loading this top level kernel. That means that we can use
relative paths from the file location to specify other kernels that
should be loaded.

KERNELS_TO_LOAD = (
  'ik/gll36001.ti',
  'ck/gll_plt_rec_1997_mav_v00.bc',
  'sclk/mk00062a.tsc',
  'spk/gll_951120_021126_raj2007.bsp',
  'fk/gll_scan_plane.tf'
