Rsm_Project
.HELP
rsm_project takes a VICAR file with a RSM and projects it to the surface.

Example:
    mars_generate_rsm /raid26/tllogan/mars/mawrth_vallis/source/unmapped/P16_007388_2049_XI_24N020W.IMG ctx1
    rsm_project --grid-spacing=10 --map-info=ctx1_ref_img.xml --number-process=20 --verbose --process-number-line=1000 --process-number-sample=1000 ctx1.img ctx1_proj.img
.LEVEL1
.variable img
The input image file to use,
which should have RSM
generated (e.g., call
mars_generate_rsm first)
.variable dem
DEM file to use. Should be XML
created by shelve_dem
.variable out
Name of output file
.variable avgfactor
The averaging factor to use
on the original data before
projecting it. If this isn't
specified, we match the map
resolution to the resolution of
center pixel of the projected
ImageGroundCollection.
Otherwise, we average by the
given factor.
.variable bbox
Use the given image to supply
the bounding box for the
output. Note that we use the
projection and bounding box,
but not the resolution of the
map info (unlike mapinfo).
This can be useful to for
example cover the area of a
generated DEM, even if the DEM
is lower resolution than what
we want to project here.
.variable cimage
Use the given image to supply
the projection. We calculate
the bounding box to cover the
image, and use the supplied
resolution. Compare with
bounding-box option, this is
useful in the same
circumstances where we might
not want to cover the entire
area of the file f.
.variable gspace
Grid spacing to exactly
calculate the image ground
connection for, doing a linear
interpolation in between. This
can greatly affect how long
the processing takes. If the
grid spacing is something like
the DEM resolution, usually
you get almost as good output
but much faster.
.variable mapinfo
Rather than generating a image
to cover the full area, match
exactly the supplied shelve
image or MapInfo. This is
useful to when comparing
against an existing image/DEM.
.variable res
Resolution in meters of output.
If negative, then we use the
center resolution of the image.
.variable nproc
Number of processors to use
.variable pline
Number of lines to include in
each tile that we work on.
This controls how long each
parallel job takes to run.
.variable psamp
Number of samples to include
in each tile that we work on.
This controls how long each
parallel job takes to run.
.variable vtype
Type of file to generate. This
should by BYTE, HALF, FULL,
REAL, or DOUB. Default is HALF
.variable verbose
Print more information as we run.
