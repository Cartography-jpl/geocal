rsm_tiepoint
.HELP
rsm_tiepoint takes a VICAR file with a RSM and projects it to the surface, and
then collects tiepoints. By default the projected image is the base image
name with "_proj" added. But you can specify any name you would like.

The image and reference_image should be VICAR files. The dem_file should be
the output of shelve_dem (e.g., a ".xml" file).
.LEVEL1
.variable img
The input image, with RSM.
.variable dem
DEM file to use. Should be XML
created by shelve_dem
.variable img
The reference image, map projected
.variable out
Output tiepoints, which is an XML
file
.VARIABLE autofit
Sets the FITMIN threshold
automatically using the first
n correlations.
.variable gspace
Grid spacing to exactly
calculate the image ground
connection for, doing a linear
interpolation in between. This
can greatly affect how long
the processing takes. If the
grid spacing is something like
the DEM resolution, usually
you get almost as good output
but much faster.
.variable fftsize
FFT window size. Default should
generally work, but if the over-
lap is very narrow, a smaller
window will be needed. Or use a
larger window if the two images
have very different resolutions
(e.g., Viking 232m vs 50m HRSC).
.variable fftgrid
Grid dimensions of FFTs to match
in line x sample order. Example:
fftgrid=(42,42)
.variable magnify
Magnify the FFT size to search a
larger area to obtain better
initial match points. 1 means
no magnification.
.variable magmin
Shrink the Magnify factor to
this size after successful
initial matching. Will increase
the number of (smaller) FFTs
fitting inside the image overlap
.variable nproc
Number of processors to use
.variable pname
Output projected image, default is
in file with "_proj" added
.variable pline
Number of lines to include in
each tile that we work on.
This controls how long each
parallel job takes to run.
.variable psamp
Number of samples to include
in each tile that we work on.
This controls how long each
parallel job takes to run.
.variable redo
At the end of processing, this
number of the first FFT match
points will be redone.
.variable seed
Number that controls the
positions of the first FFT
match points. Use a different
number if the first image 
matching points results in poor
registration accuracy.
.variable thr_res
Prevent offset correlations
further than this value from the
predicted location from entering
into the model fit. Prevents
gross blunders. Note this is in
the (lower) resolution of the
Reference image.
.variable toler
Tolerance used to reject matched
points as blunders. 
.variable verbose
Print more information as we run.
