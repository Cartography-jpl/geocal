Print out information about a NITF file.

By default we use to output based on gdalinfo, which gives a good summary.

However, we also own NITF parser. Using the "--full" option will print out
much more complete information, but it can be a fairly long summary.

Options:
  -h --help         
       Print this message

  --full
       Print out much more complete information about the NITF file

  -v --version      
       Print program version
