This contains optional code that can be included to serialize GeoCal classes
using boost serialization. This is optional, if you don't include this then
none of this code will be included.

This is entirely done through header files, so code using geocal can
decide to use this or not.

Users of this class that want Boost serializations should:
1. Define "USE_BOOST_SERIALIZATON" before including headers
2. Include all supported archive types before including any
   GeoCal headers.
3. Either directly use BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT for supported classes,
   or the appropriate header files that define this (e.g.,
   geocal_serialize.h for everything, geocal_serialize_camera.h for
   Camera and derived classes, etc.

See the image_coordinate_test.cc unit test for an example of this,
we use this particularly simple class as a test of the
serialization. 

Note that if you add serialization to a class, you should make sure
it gets added to one of the files in Serialize directory.
