This supplies the python GeoCal library.

Note that the python is code is tested by "installcheck". This is because
we need to install the python module before we can test it. You can also
run the python check directly as "make python-check".

If you need to install needed python libraries (e.g., you are building a 
virtual environment), there is a requirements.txt file
that can be used with pip by "pip install -r requirements.txt"
