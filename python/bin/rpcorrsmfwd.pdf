VICAR Program rpcorrsmfwd
.HELP
PURPOSE

     This is like RPCFWD, but works with file that either has a RPC
     or a RSM. Otherwise, this should be a drop in replacement.

.PAGE
TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

     rpcorrsmfwd INP=(A,B) COLS=(C1,C2,C3,C4,C5)
     
     where

     A           is an IBIS file 
     B		 is a VICAR image with a GeoTIFF label with RPC or a
                      standalone ascii GeoTIFF label with RPC
     COLS        are the IBIS file columns (integers) contain-
                      ing the (lon,lat,elev) and to contain the
                      (line,sample) 
.PAGE
OPERATION
   The GeoTIFF label is accessed and the RPC or RSM is read.  The (lon,lat,elv)
   columns of the ibis file are read, then plugged into the RPC or RSM to yield
   the (line,samp) columns.

   Note the original rpcfwd add 0.5 pixels to the line and sample calculated
   by the RPC. It isn't really clear why this done, I don't think this is
   actually the correct behavior. Not sure if we should duplicate this for
   some obscure reason, or if we should just return the actual line/sample.
   We are currently doing what I think is "right", so this will be 0.5 pixels
   off from the old rpc program.
