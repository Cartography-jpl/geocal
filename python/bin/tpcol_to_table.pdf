.HELP
Short utility to write a tie-point collection out in an ASCII CSV table format.
You can either supply a reference image, or leave this off. If supplied, we
give the ground location both as longitude/latitude/height and as reference
image line/sample Without the reference image we leave off the reference line
and sample.

For larger tie-point collections, you can automatically generate the data
compressed by just adding a standard compression extension (e.g., foo.csv.bz2).
The extensions '.gz', '.bz2', '.zip' and '.xz' are supported.
.LEVEL1
.variable tpcol
Input tie-point collection
.variable out
Output ASCII file
.variable refimg
Optional reference image
.variable useorigimg
Special note for using with mars_nest.
The tie-points are relative to the
image that has matched. This is the
same as the input images *except* in
the case you have used the one of the
options like "userefproj" or "useproj".
In that case, the input image is
reprojected before we do the image
matching. The tie-points are then
relative to the reprojected image.  If
instead you want the CSV file generated
by this program to be relative to the
original (not reprojected) image,
specify the "useorigimg" option.
