VICAR program pan_sharpen - Create pan sharpened images
.HELP
PURPOSE
  This create a set of pan sharpened images from a pan band and a set
  of multipspectral bands (at lower resolution). Because we are
  reading the data anyways, we also log the panchromatic file.

  This can be *before* doing orthorectification, i.e., it can be run
  on the raw worldview 2 data (e.g., NITF, VICAR converted from
  NITF). You can also run this after orthorectification if desired.

  This uses the pan sharpening algorithm described in "WorldView-2
  Pan-Sharpening" by Chris Padwick et. al. (ASPRS 2010 Annual
  Conference).

  The input files should be anything readable by GDAL (e.g., NITF,
  VICAR). The panchromatic band is entered first, followed by the
  multispectral band. Note for the multipspectral if you are using
  VICAR you can specify multiple bands using ':', so for example
  'my_ms_b1:8.img'.  You can also list each of the multiple bands 
  seperately.

  This will always trim 3 pixels from the full size of the pan image.
  This is because we do a 7x7 convolution in the pan sharpening, and
  rather than doing something clever at the edges we just don't do
  anything at the border.

  You specify only the band 1 output file name, which should end with
  '_b1'. We add the other bands to give the full band names. S for
  example 'my_ps_b1.img'.

CALL
    pan_sharpen INP force_rpc="y" OUT
  WHERE:
    INP          1) The panchromatic data, anything readable by GDAL
                 2) The multispectral data, anything readable by GDAL.
                    For VICAR input, specify using ':' for band range,
                    so 'my_ms_b1:8.img'. Alternatively, you can
                    list each band separately.
    FORCE_RPC    Sometimes an image will have both map information
                 and an RPC. In this case, we use the map information by
                 preference, unless directed by Force_rpc being y.
    OUT          Output VICAR file, should have '_b1' in name, 
                 so 'my_ps_b1.img'

OPERATION

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
The panchromatic data, anything 
readable by GDAL, and the 
multispectral data, anything 
readable by GDAL. For VICAR 
input, specify using ':' 
for band range, so 
'my_ms_b1:8.img'
.VARIABLE FORCE_RPC
Sometimes an image will have both map information
and an RPC. In this case, we use the map information by
preference, unless directed by Force_rpc being true.
.VARIABLE OUT
Output VICAR file, should have 
'_b1' in name, so 'my_ps_b1.img'
.end
