# Add three new logging level to capture diff, diff_but_ignored and
# diff_detailed. We are using
# logging which generally is used to report errors to instead report
# information about differences.
#
# While we could add new level names using logging.addLevelName,
# the python documentation points out
# (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#custom-levels) that this
# is a global namespace. We don't want to have any other library that uses
# pynitf forced to use the new level names. So instead, we have a special
# formatter DifferenceFormatter that handles this without adding new names.
#
# Also, if for whatever reason the specific level choosen for the new levels
# causes a problem you can redefine the levels used by changing the value
# of "DIFFERENCE_FOUND", "DIFFERENCE_FOUND_BUT_IGNORED" and "DIFFERENCE_DETAIL"

# ERROR is at 40, WARNING at 30, so the first two are just after ERROR
# in reporting importance.

DIFFERENCE_FOUND_BUT_IGNORED = 38
# INFO is at 21, so this is just above it in importance
