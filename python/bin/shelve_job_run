This runs a job that is a pickled function stored in a shelve
database file. The function should take no arguments, we just 
execute the save function. This is useful when doing things like
submitting jobs to torque.

You don't normally run this directly, rather this gets run as
part of a torque job.

We normally get the database file from the environment variable
"SHELVE_DATABASE_FILE", and the index of the job from "PBS_ARRAYID".
You can also pass this on the command line, which can be useful when
testing to directly run a job.

  -h --help
