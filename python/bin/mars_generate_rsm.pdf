Mars_Generate_Rsm
.HELP
mars_generate_rsm takes an unprojected PDS image, imports it to VICAR, 
and adds a RSM.

We do not do any radiance correction (e.g., dark current subtraction),
we just pass through the DNs unchanged. However, for CTX camera the
data is at level 0 is normally SQRT encoded. We do expand that out to 
unencoded data.

Currently the specific forms of the RSM are hard coded based on the 
instrument type.

It is not clear what we should do with masked pixels (e.g., CTX), right 
now, we are just removing them.

We are not currently including camera nonlinearities (e.g., HRSC), this 
is something we could add in the future.

Example:
    mars_generate_rsm /raid26/tllogan/mars/mawrth_vallis/source/unmapped/P16_007388_2049_XI_24N020W.IMG ctx1
    rsm_project --grid-spacing=10 --map-info=ctx1_ref_img.xml --number-process=20 --verbose --process-number-line=1000 --process-number-sample=1000 ctx1.img ctx1_proj.img

.LEVEL1
.variable pdsimg
The PDS image we are importing
and adding a RSM to.
.variable outbase
Name to use when forming the
first part of the output file
names.
.variable fulligc

For diagnostic purposes, it
can be useful to have the full
IGC (i.e., the one with the
camera model, spice kernel,
etc.). This is what we
are approximating with the
RSM.
.variable minh
Minimum DEM height we create
RSM for. Note this doesn't
need to be super accurate,
just a reasonable value that
is lower than any height we
will encounter over the area.
.variable .maxh
Maximum DEM height we create
RSM for. Note this doesn't
need to be super accurate,
just a reasonable value that
is lower than any height we
will encounter over the area.
.variable plot 
To evaluate the quality of the
generated RSM, this takes a
cross section for all lines,
and 5 equally spaced samples
and plots the difference
between the calculated line
and sample vs. what the full
ImageGroundConnection
calculation creates. Output
is a PDF file.
