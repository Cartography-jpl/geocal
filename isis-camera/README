This is a short little program to interact directly with the ISIS library
for a camera model. We've saved this just in case we ever need to do this
again.

We can already access the camera model through campt program, which is
wrapped up in the python IsisIgc. However it can be useful to directly
do the camera model calculations step by step if we are figuring out how to
duplicate a ISIS camera. We can't easily link to the ISIS library, it has
a number of dependencies that conflict with the geocal dependencies. But we
have a stand alone program here that allows us to simply tweak the program
to look through the ISIS camera model.
