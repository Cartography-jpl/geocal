Mars_Nest
.HELP
mars_nest co-registers two mars orbital images with map/georeferences.
The two input images are imported into VICAR using GDAL, and the out-
put is VICAR-GT (georeferenced) which can be converted (separately) to
GeoTIFF or other user-desired format. The first image is the Reference
to which the Second image will be co-registered/warped. If the pixel
resolutions are not the same, the Reference image should be the lower
resolution of the two images. The default is for the output to assume
the Second image's projection although this can be changed via the
"userefproj" parameter. The images are resampled and output at both the
resolution of the Second image as well as the Reference image. Output
filenames are created by the program using the user-supplied
"refbase" and "refresname" parameters, and then "imgbase" and
"imgresname" parameters. The warped Second image output has the
additional suffix "corr" added to the filename. All the output files
are provided as VICAR-GT ".img" files. The resolution name parameters 
(refresname/imgresname) can be any text, e.g., "5m", "res1", but they
must be different text if the resolutions are different.

Example filenames:
 mars_nest  refimg=P14_006644_1747_XI_05S222W_8bit.tif +
            refbase=ctx refres=5m +
            img=ESP_025012_1745_RED_8bitrender.tif +
            imgbase=hirise imgres=0.25m
Would result in: ctx_5m.img ctx_0.25m.img hirise_corr_5m.img and 
hirise_corr_0.25m.img

General usage example:
parm input1 string def="h1154_0000.nd4.53_hrsc_stereo.tif"
parm input2 string def="h3663_0000.nd4.50_hrsc_sin.tif"

mars_nest   refimg=&input1 refbase=hrsc1154 refres=50m +
            img=&input2 imgbase=hrsc3663 imgres=12m +
            fftsize=256 fftgrid=(42,42) magnify=4 magmin=2 +
            userefpr="y"
xvd         (hrsc1154_50m.img,hrsc3663_corr_50m.img,hrsc3663_corr_50m.img)


.LEVEL1
.variable refimg
Reference image to import into
VICAR. Can be any file type
GDAL can read (or VICAR).
.variable refbase
Name to use when forming the
first part of the output
Reference filename.
.variable refresname
Name describing the original
resolution of the Reference
image, e.g., "5m", "res1".
Used to form the second part of
the output filename.
.variable img
Second image to import into
VICAR. It is the image that will
be warped. Can be any file type
GDAL can read (including VICAR).
.variable imgbase
Name to use when forming the
first part of the output Second
filename.
.variable imgresname
Name describing the original
resolution of the Second image,
e.g., "0.25m", "res2". Used to
form the second part of the
output filename.
.VARIABLE autofit
Sets the FITMIN threshold
automatically using the first
n correlations.
.variable bandref
The band number to use if the
input Reference image contains
multiple bands.
.variable bandimg
The band number to use if the
input Second image contains
multiple bands.
.variable border
Add a border of the given
number of pixels when we
resample. This border is
in pixels of the second
image (not the reference
image). This is useful for
large corrections, where the
image may shift outside of
the original bounding box.
.variable fftsize
FFT window size. Default should
generally work, but if the over-
lap is very narrow, a smaller
window will be needed. Or use a
larger window if the two images
have very different resolutions
(e.g., Viking 232m vs 50m HRSC).
.variable fftgrid
Grid dimensions of FFTs to match
in line x sample order. Example:
fftgrid=(42,42)
.variable  hirisecorr
Hirise imagery in equirectan-
gular projection appears to have
the latitude_of_origin and
standard_parallel_1 swapped for
some cases. This option turns on
heuristics to identify and
correct the problem. Default is
"n". Enter "y" to perform the
correction.
.variable magnify
Magnify the FFT size to search a
larger area to obtain better
initial match points. 1 means
no magnification.
.variable magmin
Shrink the Magnify factor to
this size after successful
initial matching. Will increase
the number of (smaller) FFTs
fitting inside the image overlap
.variable nah
Number of grid cells in the
Sample direction used for
warping the final image.
.variable nav
Number of grid cells in the Line
direction used for warping the
final image.
.variable polyfit
When warping the Second image to
the Reference image, the default
is to triangulate using each
FFT match point. Optionally, the
mapping can be constrained to a
LINEAR, KEYSTONE, QUAD, or CUBIC
polynomial fit. See the VICAR
Proc "tieconv" for more details.
.variable redo
At the end of processing, this
number of the first FFT match
points will be redone.
.variable seed
Number that controls the
positions of the first FFT
match points. Use a different
number if the first image 
matching points results in poor
registration accuracy.
.variable scl
Value to scale the input image by,
useful if the input data is
floating for example.
.variable thr_res
Prevent offset correlations
further than this value from the
predicted location from entering
into the model fit. Prevents
gross blunders. Note this is in
the (lower) resolution of the
Reference image.
.variable toler
Tolerance used to reject matched
points as blunders.
.variable usemap
Like useproj, specifies an
image with a projection
georeference to be used for the
output registered products
instead of the projection of
the input Reference or Second
images. In addition, the
ref_image_resolution_name 
version of files will exactly
match the pixel size and extent
of the given image (e.g., you
can load them both in xvd).
This is useful when bringing
a set of images into one
overall common set.
.variable useproj
Specifies an image with a
projection georeference to be
used for the output registered
products instead of the pro-
jection of the input Reference
or Second images. Can be useful
for bringing everything to a
common projection.
.variable userefproj
Use the input Reference image's
projection for the output
images instead of the default
Second image's projection.
