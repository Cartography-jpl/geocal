.HELP
Short utility to write a tie-point collection out in an ASCII CSV table format.
You can either supply a reference image, or leave this off. If supplied, we
give the ground location both as longitude/latitude/height and as reference
image line/sample Without the reference image we leave off the reference line
and sample.

For larger tie-point collections, you can automatically generate the data
compressed by just adding a standard compression extension (e.g., foo.csv.bz2).
The extensions '.gz', '.bz2', '.zip' and '.xz' are supported.
