When working with the CartLab data, it became more and more desirable to have
a widget that could be used to display RasterImage or MapImage, with the
ability to overlay images on top of each other and add simple annotation (e.g.,
a cross mark, or text). Really we are looking for something like the
ERDAS imagine image viewer, but as something that can be embedded into a
large GUI and that isn't Microsoft Windows based.

Somewhat surprisingly, there were no packages out there that I could find
that was able to do this. It seems like a pretty natural and basic function,
but apparently nobody has implemented this yet.

The code in this directory is a simple implementation in the GTK. It
works at a fairly low level. I imagine this will grow into a coding
monstrosity that will end up being hard to maintain. This is
unfortunate, but I don't see any easy way around this right now.

It would be nice if somebody developed a real library to do this as a 
thirdparty open source library. If that happens, we can chuck this entire
directory of code and replace it.
