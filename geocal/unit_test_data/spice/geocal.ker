This is a list of kernels to load in for use by geocal. Right now, we
always load the same kernels. We could do something more complicated if
needed in the future.

As a convention, we always change to the directory this file is located
in before loading this top level kernel. That means that we can use
relative paths from the file location to specify other kernels that
should be loaded.

If you update the version of other kernels, you need to also update this
file to point to the updated versions.
