Note if you want to run tests locally (useful when you are initially running
code), there is a directory ../geocal that makes this uninstalled .py files
look like a module. You can set up for testing by adding this to your
python search path, e.g.,:

pistol% source setup_env_with_afids.sh
pistol% export PYTHONPATH=/home/smyth/Local/geocal-repo/python:${PYTHONPATH}
