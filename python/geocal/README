This just shuffles things around so we have direct access to the python library
w/o doing an install. Just a convenience when debugging/testing, this isn't
actually used in the delivered version.

To use this in testing, should add python to PYTHON search path, e.g.:

pistol% source setup_env_with_afids.sh
pistol% export PYTHONPATH=/home/smyth/Local/geocal-repo/python:${PYTHONPATH}
