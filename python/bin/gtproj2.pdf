.TITLE
VICAR/IBIS Program "gtproj2"
.HELP
PURPOSE

   This is an updated version of "gtproj", which extends the 
number of map projections supported. In particular, this adds
support for projections on other planets (e.g., mars). This is 
intended to be a drop in replacement, acting the same for map 
projections already support by gtproj and working seamlessly 
with other projections.

   "gtproj2" converts map coordinates from one map projection 
to another.  The input can either by (x,y) or (x,y,z) columns
in an IBIS file.  If two columns are specified (the x,y case), 
then an all-zero z column is generated.  Similarly, if no z 
column is provided for output, then the z output is ignored.  
The name of the IBIS file is the first element of the
INP parameter.

   The map coordinate specifications for both input and output
must be in the headers of two files which are the second and 
third elements of the INP parameter. The original "gtproj"
program required these files to be VICAR files, but "gtproj2" 
can work with any file GDAL can read (e.g., tif). These files 
must have map projection information, so in the case of VICAR
thte GeoTIFF state labels.

If zero or one datum is given, then the conversion will assume
same datum for input and output.  If both input and output have
a datum, then datum conversion will take place as well.
 
The columns in the IBIS file for coordinate I/O are given
by the parameters INCOL and OUTCOL.

The original gtproj had an optional EP_PAR parameter. This 
doesn't seem to actually be used anywhere, so we don't support
this in gtproj2. We could if this ended up being an issue.

The 'EPSOC and 'TEC keywords are used in gtproj to select alternative 
mapping packages. For compatibility we accept this keyword (so old
code doesn't break), but this doesn't actually do anything. In all
cases we use geocal to do the coordinate conversions.

EXAMPLE

gtproj2 (myibisfile,img_lambert,img_albers) incol=(2,3,4) outcol=(5,6,7)


RESTRICTIONS

None.  The IBIS column length is dynamically allocated.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
 IBIS interface file, the
 input GeoTIFF ref header,
 and the output GeoTIFF
 ref header
.VARIABLE INCOL
 (x,y) or (x,y,z) to be mapped
.VARIABLE OUTCOL
 (x,y) or (x,y,z) output
.VARIABLE ALTMAP
 'EPOSC - accepted for backwards compatiblity,
          doesn't do anything
 'TEC - accepted for backwards compatiblity,
          doesn't do anything

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
All three files are required.  The GeoTIFF references are
in the state part of the VICAR header for VICAR files.

See VICAR routine GTGEN for methods of creating GeoTIFF header
files.
.VARIABLE INCOL
If a z column is not provided by the user, the program will
provide a zero filled z column for input to the mapping
routines.

It would be unusual, but it is allowed to have (x,y) input and 
(x,y,z) output, or vice-versa.
.VARIABLE OUTCOL
If a z column is not provided by the user, the program will
discard the z column from the mapping routines.

It would be unusual, but it is allowed to have (x,y) input and 
(x,y,z) output, or vice-versa.
