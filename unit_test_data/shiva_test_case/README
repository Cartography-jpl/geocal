This data was extracted from the version 2.2b of Shiva, the Port Gaston test
case. This used The pre image of 10MAY21184840-P1BS-052366905020_01_P001.NTF
and the post image of 10MAY16183214-P1BS-052366900030_01_P001.NTF and
10MAY16183214-M1BS-052366900030_01_P001.NTF.

We have extracted the data from the run, both to use as input and to compare
replacement code we are writing for the 2.2 software. The data was extracted
using the script subset_test.py, and extracts a 200x300 area around the test
targets.
