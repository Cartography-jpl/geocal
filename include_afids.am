# We want to be able to generate both a stand alone Makefile for 
# GeoCal, and an integrated one for AFIDS. Unfortunately, automake
# doesn't let us use a variable in a "include" line, so as a work around
# we have 2 files "include.am" and "include_afids.am". The only difference
# is that include_afids.am adds a "afids_python/" directory in front of
# everything.
#
# If you change include.am, make sure to change include_afids.am and
# vice versa.
